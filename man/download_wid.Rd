\description{
Downloads data from the World Wealth and Income Database
(\url{http://WID.world}) into a \code{data.frame}.
Type \code{vignette("wid-demo")} for a detailed presentation.
}
\details{
Although all arguments default to \code{"all"}, you cannot download the
entire database by typing \code{download_wid()}. The command requires you
to specify either some indicators or some areas. \strong{To download the entire
database, please visit \url{https://wid.world/data/} and choose "download
full dataset".}

If there is no data matching you selection on WID.world (maybe because
you specified an indicator or an area that doesn't exist), the command
will return \code{NULL} with a warning.

All monetary amounts for countries and country subregions are in constant
local currency of the reference year (i.e. the previous year, the database
being updated every year around July). Monetary amounts for world regions
are in EUR PPP of the reference year. You can access the price index using
the indicator \code{inyixx}, the PPP exchange rates using \code{xlcusp}
(USD), \code{xlceup} (EUR), \code{xlcyup} (CNY), and the market exchange
rates using \code{xlcusx} (USD), \code{xlceux} (EUR), \code{xlcyux}
(CNY). To check the current reference year, you can look at when the price
index is equal to 1.

Shares and wealth/income ratios are given as a fraction of 1. That is,
a top 1\% share of 20\% is given as 0.2. A wealth/income ratio of
300\% is given as 3.

The arguments of the command follow a nomenclature specific to WID.world.
We provide more details with a few examples below. \strong{For the complete
up-to-date documentation of the structure of the database, please visit
\url{https://wid.world/codes-dictionary}.}

\subsection{Indicators}{
The argument \code{indicators} is a vector of 6-letter codes that corresponds to a
given series type for a given income or wealth concept. The first letter
correspond to the type of series. Some of the most common possibilities include:
\tabular{rcl}{
\bold{one-letter code} \tab      \tab \bold{description}     \cr
\code{a} \tab      \tab average (local currency unit, last year’s prices) \cr
\code{b} \tab      \tab inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient \cr
\code{f} \tab      \tab female population (fraction between 0 and 1) \cr
\code{g} \tab      \tab Gini coefficient (between 0 and 1) \cr
\code{i} \tab      \tab index \cr
\code{n} \tab      \tab population \cr
\code{s} \tab      \tab share (fraction between 0 and 1) \cr
\code{t} \tab      \tab threshold (local currency unit, last year’s prices) \cr
\code{m} \tab      \tab total (local currency unit, last year’s prices) \cr
\code{p} \tab      \tab proportion of women (fraction between 0 and 1) \cr
\code{w} \tab      \tab wealth-to-income ratio or labor/capital share (fraction of national income) \cr
\code{r} \tab      \tab Top 10/Bottom 50 ratio  \cr
\code{x} \tab      \tab exchange rate (market or PPP)  \cr
\code{e} \tab      \tab Total emissions (tons of CO2 equivalent emissions) \cr
\code{k} \tab      \tab Per capita emissions (tons of CO2 equivalent emissions) \cr
\code{l} \tab      \tab Average per capita group emissions (tons of CO2 equivalent per capita emissions) \cr
}

The next five letters correspond a concept (usually of income and wealth).
Some of the most common possibilities include:
\tabular{rcl}{
\bold{five-letter code} \tab      \tab \bold{description} \cr
\code{ptinc} \tab      \tab pre-tax national income \cr
\code{pllin} \tab      \tab pre-tax labor income    \cr
\code{pkkin} \tab      \tab pre-tax capital income  \cr
\code{fiinc} \tab      \tab fiscal income           \cr
\code{hweal} \tab      \tab net personal wealth     \cr
}

For example, \code{sfiinc} corresponds to the share of fiscal income,
\code{ahweal} corresponds to average personal wealth. If you don't specify
any indicator, it defaults to \code{"all"} and downloads all available indicators. 
Check \url{https://wid.world/codes-dictionary/} for a full list of codes.

\subsection{Area codes}{
All data in WID.world is associated to a given area, which can be a country,
a region within a country, an aggregation of countries (eg. a continent), or
even the whole world. The argument \code{areas} is a vector of codes that specify
the areas for which to retrieve data. Countries and world regions are coded
using 2-letter ISO codes. Country subregions are coded as \code{XX-YY}
where \code{XX} is the country 2-letter code. If you don't specify any area,
it defaults to \code{"all"} and downloads data for all available areas.
}

\subsection{Years}{
All data in WID.world correspond to a year. Some series go as far back as
the 1800s. The argument \code{years} is a vector of integer that specify
those years. If you don't specify any year, it defaults to \code{"all"}
and downloads data for all available years.
}

\subsection{Percentiles}{
The key feature of WID.world is that it provides data on the whole
distribution, not just totals and averages. The argument \code{perc}
is a vector of strings that indicate for which part of the distribution
the data should be retrieved. For share and average variables,
percentiles correspond to percentile ranges and take the form \code{pXXpYY}.
For example the top 1\% share correspond to \code{p99p100}. The top 10\% share
excluding the top 1\% is \code{p90p99}. Thresholds associated to the
percentile group \code{pXXpYY} correspond to the minimal income or wealth
level that gets you into the group. For example, the threshold of the
percentile group \code{p90p100} or \code{p90p91} correspond to the 90\%
quantile. Variables with no distributional meaning use the percentile p0p100.
If you don't specify any percentile, it defaults to \code{"all"} and
downloads data for all available parts of the distribution.
}

\subsection{Age groups}{
Data may only concern the population in a certain age group.
The argument \code{ages} is a vector of age codes that specify which
age categories to retrieve. Ages are coded using 3-digit codes.
Some of the most common possibilities include:
\tabular{rcl}{
\bold{three-digit code} \tab      \tab \bold{description} \cr
\code{999} \tab      \tab all ages \cr
\code{014} \tab      \tab ages 0 to 14 \cr
\code{156} \tab      \tab ages 15 to 64 \cr
\code{997} \tab      \tab ages 65 and older \cr
\code{991} \tab      \tab ages below 20 \cr
\code{992} \tab      \tab ages 20 and older \cr
}
If you don't specify any age, it defaults to \code{"all"} and downloads
data for all available age groups. Visit \url{https://wid.world/codes-dictionary/} 
for a comprehensive list of options.
}

\subsection{Population types}{
The data in WID.world can refer to different types of population
(i.e. different statistical units). The argument \code{pop} is a vector of
population codes. They are coded using one-letter codes. Some of the
most common possibilities include:
\tabular{rcl}{
\bold{one-letter code} \tab      \tab \bold{description} \cr
\code{i} \tab      \tab individuals \cr
\code{j} \tab      \tab equal-split adults (i.e., income or wealth divided equally among spouses) \cr
\code{m} \tab      \tab male \cr
\code{f} \tab      \tab female \cr
\code{t} \tab      \tab tax unit \cr
\code{e} \tab      \tab employed \cr
}
If you don't specify any code, it defaults to \code{"all"}
and downloads data for all available populations.
}

\subsection{Extrapolations/interpolations}{
Some of the data on WID.world is the result of interpolations (when data
is only available for a few years) or extrapolations (when data is not
available for the most recent years) that are based on much more limited
information that other data points. We include these
interpolations/extrapolation by default as a convenience, and also because
these values are used to perform regional aggregations. Yet we stress that
these estimates, especially at the level of individual countries, can be
fragile.

For many purposes, it can be preferable to exclude these data points.
For that, use the option \code{include_extrapolations = FALSE}.
